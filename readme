# Improving Population Health by Testing Insulin Sensitivity to Predict Type 2 Diabetes
The current method of identifying and measuring Type 2 Diabetes is almost exclusively based on testing the standard A1C blood glucose test. However, this method alone can result in missing the long window of early detection for the disease, as blood glucose will usually only begin to rise once the person is already insulin-resistant, indicating that their mechanism of keeping blood sugar in check has already become ineffective. Early detection and treatment of the progression towards Type 2 Diabetes is essential for the improvement of personal and public health.
