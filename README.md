# Improving Population Health by Testing Insulin Sensitivity to Predict Type 2 Diabetes
The current method of measuring and diagnosing Type 2 Diabetes is primarily based on the standard A1C blood glucose test. However, this method alone can result in missing the 
long window of early detection for the disease by years or even decades, as blood glucose will typically only rise once a person is already insulin-resistant, meaning that their 
mechanism of keeping blood sugar within a normal range has already become compromised. Early detection and treatment is essential for the improvement of individual health outcomes 
as well as reducing the population burden of the disease. By increasing the prevalence of insulin sensitivity testing, at-risk individuals could recieve earlier interventions and 
ultimately achieve greater health outcomes.
